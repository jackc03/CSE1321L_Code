/*Was not able to understand assignment. I do not know what was meant by ClassID or having
the 3 fighter types as attributes. I have no clue how the format described would be able
to accomplished the assigned task. Object arrays fo rassignment 7A are not in our notes
nor are derived classes which I assume is what is wanted for assignment 7B.*/
